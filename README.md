AirBnB clone

The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

The console can be run in interactive mode and non_interactive mode:
Interactive: type ./console.py
A prompt will appear (hbnb). You can then type commands and get the desired output

Non-interactive: The same commands can be used to run non-interactive mode with some modifications will produce the same results
ex: type "echo "all" | ./console.py"

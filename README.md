## AirBnB clone

With this project we will deploy a simple copy of the AirBnB website on our server.

The console can be run in interactive mode and non-interactive mode:
Interactive: type ./console.py
A prompt will appear (hbnb), from which you can then type commands and get the desired output

Non-interactive: 
The same commands can be used to run non-interactive mode with some modifications will produce the same results
ex: type "echo "all" | ./console.py"
